The Hash table is based on a List of lists(or buckets) which contain the data in an efficient manner.

The functions:

The Couple class allows for easy access to the position of a term in the Hash Table

- findPosition(String term) : returns the position for a term

- createHash(String Key) : returns the hash key, it is computed as the sum of the characters modulo the size

- add(String term) : add an element to the Hash Table

- containsTerm(String Term) : checks if the term has already been added to the HashTable, returns true or false

- getSize() : get the size of the Hash Table

These methods are then used by the Symbol Table by calling them.
