The Hash table is based on a List of lists(or buckets) which contain the data in an efficient manner.

The functions:

The Couple class allows for easy access to the position of a term in the Hash Table

- findPosition(String term) : returns the position for a term

- createHash(String Key) : returns the hash key, it is computed as the sum of the characters modulo the size

- add(String term) : add an element to the Hash Table

- containsTerm(String Term) : checks if the term has already been added to the HashTable, returns true or false

- getSize() : get the size of the Hash Table

These methods are then used by the Symbol Table by calling them.

The ProgramInternalForm is based on a List of Couples(each couple contains an element and its position in the SymbolTable).
Example: 
	SEPARATOR:  '$'  AT POSITION: {-1,-1}	
	RESERVED WORD:  'integer'  AT POSITION: {-1,-1}
	IDENTIFIER: 'a'  AT POSITION: {97,0}

Regexes used:

- For Identifying the Constants:

	- Matching numbers(with all variances, +/-, 0 case): "^0|[-|+]?[1-9][0-9]*"

	- Matching characters(digit or letter enclosed by ''): "^'[a-zA-Z0-9]'"

	- Matching strings(a sequence of digits and letters enclosed by "" ): "^\"[0-9a-zA-Z]*\""

- For Identifying the Identifiers: "^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*"

	- Matching the a sequence that starts with a letter followed by letters or digits
